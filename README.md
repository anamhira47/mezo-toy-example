# MeZO toy example

This repository contains a simple and baseline implementation of the Memory Effecient Zeroth order Optimization (MeZO) algorithm. The purpose of this implementation is to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of how MeZO works.

The code demonstrates the application of MeZO on a quadratic loss function. It uses basic hyperparameters and a simple data loader for the training data. The loss and accuracy of the model are plotted over time to visualize the performance of the algorithm.

This implementation is not optimized for high performance but rather for educational purposes. It is a great starting point for those who want to understand the underlying mechanics of MeZO before diving into more complex and optimized implementations.
